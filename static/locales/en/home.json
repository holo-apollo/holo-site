  "technologyDescription": "Screen printing technology is a method of directly transferring ink to paper or fabric through a screen form.<br/><br/>This method allows ink to be applied to paper of any density and color. That is, even to black super-dense cardboard. None of the existing printing methods can achieve this result. Products printed by screen printing are visually different from conventional printing. The ink has texture, you can add sparkles to it, or varnish it.<br/><br/>Silk screen printing is an ancient technology that was used in China and Japan back in the 5th century.<br/>Silk threads in the form of a net were pulled onto a dense wooden frame. Using starch and natural dyes, a pattern was transferred through this sieve onto paper and fabric.<br/><br/>Now thin synthetic threads are used instead of silk. Instead of starch, special light-sensitive photo emulsions are used.<br/><br/>Only one color can be printed at a time. A separate frame is used to print each color.",
